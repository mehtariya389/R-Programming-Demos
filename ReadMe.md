# R Programming Demos

This repository showcases my proficiency in R programming with examples of mathematical operations and matrix manipulations. These scripts demonstrate my ability to work with modular arithmetic, elliptic curve properties, and matrix operations, which are essential in cryptography and data analysis.

## Contents

### 1. Elliptic Curve Calculations (`elliptic_curve_calculations.R`)
This script performs operations related to elliptic curves over finite fields, including:
- Calculating modular values based on specific input parameters.
- Checking for the non-singularity of an elliptic curve.
- Finding and listing points on the elliptic curve.
- Calculating the order of the elliptic curve group.

### 2. Matrix Operations for Key Recovery (`matrix_operations_key_recovery.R`)
This script demonstrates matrix operations to recover a key by:
- Manipulating plaintext and ciphertext matrices.
- Identifying columns that differ by a single bit.
- Reconstructing the key matrix using the sum of mod 2 differences.
